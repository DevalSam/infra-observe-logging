To get things started here we need to have ansible installed on our loacl machine 
the best way to ensure it is properly done is by following the exact directions listed 
out in the ansible official documentation using the link below 
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html

after your installation has been done successfully you can complete your setup by coping
the exact file in our ansible.cfg and hosts directories and edit to suit your occassion 

The ansible.cfg file has the necessary configurations to get things started here
but we'll need to configure our hosts file with the right ip-addresses in order set the ball rolling 

following the example steps already found in our hosts file we can countinue to 
create more groups and sub-groups as the need arises
