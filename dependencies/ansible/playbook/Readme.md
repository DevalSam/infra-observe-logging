The logging.yml and the monitoring.yml files will get you started on the necessary directories to be created by docker in servers 

all we have to do now is run the playbook to get thins started 
run ansible-playbook playbook/logging.yml
or  ansible-playbook playbook/monitoring.yml

next will all the other applications as the need arises 
to get a clearer picture of the right order of installation and deployments refer to the Readme file in the home directory
