	# Head over to your grafana dashboard and add promotheus as a datasource for the node you'd like to monitor

	# First select the type of visualization preferred ( we'll go with a graph for this first one ) 
	
	# now select a datasource whcih in this case should prometheus, since it has our node exporter plugged in
	
	# time to fill in the metrics which in this case is for our virtual machines total CPU time in seconds 
	
	# in the metrics box type in the desired type of metrics and add more panels as required and so on
